Actually, that is wrong. I picked up â€˜ReWorkâ€™ by the 37 Signals guys and read it cover to cover, so thatâ€™s no longer on the list ðŸ˜‰Â Â  â€“ what a great book. Full of down to earth pragmatic advice and common sense (as youâ€™d expect from these guys), a ton of snippets to take away and really inspiring. I must read this again to make sure I got everything.

It seems that ‘Document Access’ from Outlook Web Access (OWA) is no longer supported in Exchange/OWA 2010.

[![image](image_thumb_1.png "image")](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/OutlookWebAccessDocumentAccess_10304/image_4.png)However, the way this element of ‘Discontinued Features and De-Emphasized Functionality’ is worded (“***Can’t use***…”) makes me think it is more of a known issue than a conscious decision they have made – where is the reasoning and/or alternative solution ? no mention…

Also, **all** of the configuration functionality for this feature still exists in Exchange 2010 Management Console.

Smells like they just didn’t get the Outlook Web App finished in time. I wonder if this will be in SP1 – it was a pretty neat feature after all – or will SP1 remove the configuration elements in the Management Console ?

But it’s still bloody annoying !

The thing is, I hate having to go across to the little ‘back arrow’ reply icon, click the dropdown next to it, just to get to the ‘actions’ I can carry out on an email.

‘Forwarding’ is two clicks when I simply want a single click for it. I’m surprised no one has come up with a greasemonkey script that does this – maybe I need to stop whinging and write myself one.

Microsoft do a good job in the old Outlook Web Access (2003 and 2007) and in the newer Outlook Web App (2010)

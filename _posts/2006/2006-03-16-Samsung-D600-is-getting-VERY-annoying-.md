This phone is getting very annoying. The user interface / experience is crappy, clunky and unintuitive.  
Samsung would do well to take a leave out of Nokia’s book – much slicker interfaces.

The annoyances are :

-   Too many steps to simply send a text message.
-   Speed Dials only work from the main screen (do not work in text message mode etc)
-   Not possible to change from speaker to bluetooth headset when listening to MP3’s (even  
    though the headset is connected and the phone shows it’s in headset mode, try changing  
    from speaker to headset and it’ll tell you it couldn’t find any headsets attached.
-   Charger / USB connection on the bottom of the phone is far too fiddly
-   Many other that I cannot think of right now (enough for an O’Reilly book – Samsung D600 Annoyances).

As soon as I find an alternative it’s getting canned!

Dasblog 1.9 is now released (see [Scott Hanselman’s announcement](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Trackback.aspx?guid=4dd4573a-1fee-4680-b28e-983271bd3ae8)). I’ve been waiting for some time for this release.

Upgrade was very simple, simply take a backup of the SiteConfig, logs and Content folders (and your themes if you’ve made edits), upload all the new files and then apply the config settings from your existing site.Config and siteSecurity.config files (or via the admin interface after setting the correct root URL in the site.config file).

tagCloud support is neat and the changes to the activity views look a lot better – although not exactly great yet (I know I should criticize until I’ve got my finger out and enhanced it to my liking – I’ll get around it sometime)

18 themes including some for mobile devices, out of the box support for Windows Live Writer (need to check if this affect / supercedes my Writer Plugin) and gravatar support.

Full report in a few days…

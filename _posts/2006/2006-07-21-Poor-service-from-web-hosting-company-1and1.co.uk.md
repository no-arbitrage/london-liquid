I have now been with web hosts [1 and 1](http://www.1and1.co.uk) for three years now, I chose them as they seemed to be big (giving the impression that I could  
expect a quality service from them) and they were also reasonably priced £4.99 per month for basic ASP.NET hosting allowing ODBC  
connections to an Access database.

Anyway there have been a couple of instances where they just stopped my account and locked me out, probably due to my credit  
card expiring or something but I never seem to have been notified and the first I know about it is when I can no longer access my email.  
The latest spat I’m having with them is the same thing, billing failed because my credit card had expired (for an amount of £25), I was  
never notified and now they’ve sent it to a debt collection agency – no doubt it’ll be incredibly difficult to it paid and have an extortionate  
admin fee associated with it – I’m looking at weeks before I get my hosting and mail back.

Thankfully, this site (kenandsarah.co.uk) is hosted by [ServerIntellect](http://www.serverintellect.com) who have been nothing but professional. The hosting is miles better,  
allowing me much better control [(I’m only using their Starter Tier)](http://www.serverintellect.com/hosting/basetier.aspx) , full ASP.NET (v1.1 or 2.0) and they send me an invoice every month  
for $9.95 (about the same as 1 and 1)…

As soon as I get the mess with 1 and 1 sorted then I’m moving all other domains over to [ServerIntellect](http://www.serverintellect.com) as well – goodbye 1 and 1 !!

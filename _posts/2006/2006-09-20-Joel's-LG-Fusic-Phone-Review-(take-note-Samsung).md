I’ve just read [Joel’s review](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/19b.html) of the free phone that Sprint gave him (hoping that he’d blog about how great it is and how great their Power Vision Network (their content) is.

Virtually everything he says about the phone itself (UI, build quality, features) stands for the Samsung D600 – I’ve been meaning to do a similar in depth review of the Samsung for a couple of months now – no need now that Joel has done it.

Samsung, in fact all phone manufacturers – yes we love features, but it is not enough to cram them in, in a ***haphazard, non integrated, non intuitive way that*** ***basically does not work correctly.***

Apple, get on and make a mobile phone in the genre of the iPod, people will buy them in their hordes.

**Alastair Mitchell Hughes** (aka ‘Wee Man’)

Two weeks in and we are starting to remember how hard this stuff is…  
– Feeding at all hours of the night  
– Nigh on **constant** nappy changing  
– Sterlizing and making up bottles

But neither of us would change it for the world. He is the spit of his big sister, very wriggly (more so than Ruby was) and that look on his face when he is well and truely zonked, head back, mouth open – Amazing !!

I got hold of Philip Laureano and we’ve been discussing the best way to make this available publically (we’ll probably lump for Sourceforge).

Interestingly he also mentioned that someone else has written a ‘SchemaBrowser’ style extension for it – giving the whole application much more power (on a par with [Codesmith](http://www.codesmithtools.com/)).

I rewrote the VS2005 addin so that instead of the UI being a ‘non integrated’ Windows Form, it is now embedded in a VS IDE ToolWindow. Some screenshots below…

Expect to see details of the sourceforge project name and possibly a CodeProject article from Philip soon...

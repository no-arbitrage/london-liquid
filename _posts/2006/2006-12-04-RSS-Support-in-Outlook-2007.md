I am/was a big fan of [RSS Popper](http://rsspopper.blogspot.com/) – when using Outlook 2003 it allowed me to pull blog posts into a selected folder in my mailbox (I used cached mode, so it was also available offline). It is currently at version 0.36 and has support for downloading enclosures (great for grabbing podcasts) and a neat feature where you can subscribe to blogs containing iCal’s (and RSS Popper automagically creates meetings in your calendar for the iCal events – sounds really cool, nothing that I’ve ever used though).

Anyway, I’ve migrated my work laptop to Vista and Office 2007 and as Outlook 2007 has built in support for RSS feeds I’ve not installed [RSS Popper](http://rsspopper.blogspot.com/). The RSS support in Outlook (apparently) based around the new Common Feed Store of Vista – this allows multiple apps to access / store your chosen RSS feeds, for example if I mark the post as ‘Read’ in IE7 then that fact is reflected when I look at it in Outlook RSS.

It’s pretty simple to define new feeds – it’s accessed from ‘Tools -> Account Settings…’ and is configured in much the same way as you configure an email account.

 Items are added to the defined folder as posts with any enclosures added as attachments to the post.

I’ve just downloaded and installed [Windows Live Writer](http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/9/a/f9a19f2d-cec4-4a25-9b0b-eb9655ea7561/Writer.msi).

After playing with it for two minutes, I’ve decided it will replace [w.Bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/) my current incumbent blogging tool.

Don’t get me wrong, [w.Bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/) is a very good tool. There site was down for a couple of weeks (which made me worry it was dead) but is now back up (to a degree) and they have a new partner for hosting their site.  
It supports all the functionality that I require

BUT…

[Windows Live Writer](http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/9/a/f9a19f2d-cec4-4a25-9b0b-eb9655ea7561/Writer.msi) just does it better !!   It automagically detected my CSS and formatted itself with it (so my posts, as I am writing them, now look they way they will on the website).  
I can create the posts in HTML view, including insertion of images etc.  
The method of selecting/configuring FTP uploads was a breeze.  
Also (maybe this is just perception/rose tinted glasses), I seem to be creating posts **A LOT** quicker than I could with [w.Bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/)

[Writer](http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/9/a/f9a19f2d-cec4-4a25-9b0b-eb9655ea7561/Writer.msi) has a much slicker interface and just seems so much more intuitive. In my simple terms [w.Bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/) looks Win2000 and [Writer](http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/9/a/f9a19f2d-cec4-4a25-9b0b-eb9655ea7561/Writer.msi) looks Win2003

I just cannot rave about [Writer](http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/9/a/f9a19f2d-cec4-4a25-9b0b-eb9655ea7561/Writer.msi) enough. It’s still a BETA, but it rocks..

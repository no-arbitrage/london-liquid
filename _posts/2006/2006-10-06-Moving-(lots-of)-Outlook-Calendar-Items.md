If you want to move ALL calendar items from an Outlook calendar in one mailbox to an Outlook calendar in another mailbox – it’s not immediately apparent how to go about this.

You can simply copy it over giving it a new name (not Calendar) but then you end up with 2 calendars and it becomes messy. Also, you cannot delete the Calendar in the destination mailbox and copy the source one over (Outlook does not allow this)

So…

-   Click on the Calendar folder
-   From the ‘View’ menu choose ‘Arrange By’ , ‘Current View’ , ‘By Category’

You should now end up with a table view of all your appointments…

-   Click on the first item in the list
-   Scroll down to the bottom of the list
-   Hold down ‘SHIFT’ and click on the last item (NOTE: Select All (CTRL A) does not work)
-   Drag all the selected items into the destination Calendar.

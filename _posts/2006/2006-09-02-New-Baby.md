He’s here !!

Born at 11:10am on Friday 1st September 2006. Weighing in at 8lbs 7oz and sporting a big pair of lungs, both he and mother are fine.

The bad news is that Sarah and I have both agreed that he doesn’t look like a ‘WILLIAM’, so we’ll have to be thinking of names over the next few days / weeks.

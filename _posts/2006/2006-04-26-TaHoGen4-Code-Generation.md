TaHoGen4 is an Open Source implementation of  
CodeSmith, completely rewritten (for .NET2.0) version of the TaHoGen code  
generation application by Philip Laureano (see his ‘old’ blog at [http://blogs.wdevs.com/philiplaureano/](http://blogs.wdevs.com/philiplaureano/)).

I grabbed a copy of the source for V4 and the  
source for the VS.Addin and hacked it around a bit to remove the dependancies on  
ManagedAddins and the Crownwood DotnetMagic control set.

I now have a version that works successfully  
in VS2005, without the dependancies. I am now trying to get hold of Philip to  
discuss developing it further.

If you would like a copy of the ‘modified’  
source I have then let me know…

Saturday 15th April – drove from Rothesay (we were visiting for the Easter weekend) to Inveruglas to do Ben Vane and Ben Ime.

It starts with a pleasant (if it wasn’t raining) 3K walk along the road towards the Dam and then turns off, over a bridge to the left. After a couple of hundred metres there is a thin path heading directly up the shoulder / ridge. It’s a nice (if strenuous) walk up the ridge, however the mist came in from about 600m and the ground started giving way to snow covered ground.  
The summit if fairly bland and we pretty much headed off straight away, down to the glen bewteen these two hills, found the highest point of the glen headed for that and crossed there.

It was then a log, tough slog up the hillside to a wide ridge – although, we headed directed for the summit up steep slopes (in very poor visibility and lots of snow underfoot).  
We actually found the summit fairly accurately, topping out directly onto it.

The walk off was very pleasant, we headed down the ridge in a South direction to the bealach and from there down in an easterly direction to the end of the forested area where there is a landrover track all the way back to the road to the Dam.

7 ish hours all in and another 2 Munros bagged (total is now 134).

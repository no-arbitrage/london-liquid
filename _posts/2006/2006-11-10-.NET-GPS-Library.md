About 4 or 5 years ago I wrote a GPS ActiveX control in VB6.0.  
Although it work really well (and fast), it was difficult to maintain – to be honest it was pretty messy, a large monolith with some real horrible 283654276354 line functions.  
I sold it as Kapie Systems for a while and had some good success with it, it was mentioned at a couple of GIS conferences etc…

Anyway, I had been meaning to update it (to .NET) for sometime, but I wanted to do it right, make it easy to extend (to plug-in other GPS protocols) and easy to maintain.

I just got a basic .NET implementation of it working last night (at last !!). It’s Garmin propriety protocol only at the moment, but the whole framework is there for extending to other protocols (which I’ll be adding shortly).  
I also added import and export to GPX format, which is a great portable standard – the GIS / Mapping community has been crying out for this for ages.

I expect to have something releasable in a few weeks (it will be open source) but if anyone wants an early view or wants to discuss my plans ideas then let me know.

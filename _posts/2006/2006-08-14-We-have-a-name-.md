After months of debating, listing, reviewing, comparing and disagreeing and with only 3 weeks to BoB Day (Birth of Baby day) we almost have a name for the new baby…

**WILLIAM**

Nest is well and truly built – the whole upstairs of the house has been redecorated, carpeted, walls knocked out and rebuilt, plastered etc etc etc in the last 2 months, all the necessary items have been purchased, hospital bag is packed, baby’s clothes are bought, washed, ironed, folded and stored in the relevant drawer / chest.

Now it’s simply a case of ‘hurry up and wait’

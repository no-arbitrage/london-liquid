[![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31xBPiFpzjL._SL160_PIsitb-dp-arrow,TopRight,21,-23_SH30_OU02_AA115_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Professional-ASP-NET-3-5-VB-Programmer/dp/0470187573/)To keep things up on the technical side, I recently received [Professional ASP.NET 3.5](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Professional-ASP-NET-3-5-VB-Programmer/dp/0470187573/), so I have that to plough through also.

I am also attending the [Business of Software 2008](http://www.businessofsoftware.org/) conference in Boston next month, where some of the sessions sound really interesting. I particularly liked the title of this [Pecha Kucha](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-09/st_pechakucha) session by **Bob Pritchett**, entrepreneur and author : **Fire someone today and other surprising tactics for making your business a success**

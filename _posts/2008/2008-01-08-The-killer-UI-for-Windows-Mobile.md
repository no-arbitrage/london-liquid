I am totally blown away by this. This is (IMHO) exactly what Windows mobile has been waiting for.

I have downloaded and am using this on my HTC TyTN II (Kaiser) – works like a dream, very easy to use and responsive to finger touch / navigation.  
There are a number of known issues with it and some reports of it not being great on devices without touch screens, but run (seriously, run very quickly) over [there](http://pointui.com/Home.aspx) and grab a copy.

It is still in beta and the guys at [Pointui](http://pointui.com/about.aspx) have made it free (paypal donation optional). Unfortunately it does not cover all apps and aspects of the Windows Mobile UI, but the parts they have covered off are stunning – when these folks get all the common apps covered (Contacts, Dialer, Mail etc) then it will be incredible!

I love the list of known issues they have on the [release announcement](http://forums.pointui.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=136) on their forums – it includes : ***Not enough time in the day*** and ***Red Bull wearing off*** – classy.

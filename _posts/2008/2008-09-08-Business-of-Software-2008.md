[![BoS](BoS_thumb.gif)](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/BusinessofSoftware2008_14B09/BoS_2.gif)Last week I attended the ‘Business of Software 2008’ conference in Boston, MA.

I cannot rave enough about this conference – the quality of the speakers, the content, the organization – everything, was fantastic.  
It was organized by [Neil Davidson](http://twitter.com/NeilDavidson) (CEO and Founder of Red-Gate Software) and [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com) ([FogCreek](http://www.fogcreek.com) and [JoelOnSoftware](http://www.joelonsoftware.com)). They did a fab job !!

Some of the speakers included :-

-   [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) (Business Week’s ‘Ultimate Entrepreneur for the information Age’)
-   Joel Spolsky ([Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com))
-   [Eric Sink](http://www.ericsink.com/) ([SourceGear](http://www.sourcegear.com/) and coiner of the phrase ‘MicroISV’)
-   Steve Johnson ([Pragmatic Marketing](http://www.pragmaticmarketing.com/))
-   [Richard Stallman](http://www.stallman.org/) (GNU operating system, Emacs and founder of the Free Software Foundation)
-   Jason Fried ([37 Signals](http://www.37signals.com/) – think ‘basecamp’)
-   Jessica Livingston ([Founders at Work](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Early/dp/1590597141/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1220912088&sr=8-1))
-   Paul Kenny ([Ocean Learning](http://oceanlearning.co.uk/?pg=about))

As well as many, many others. It covered all the key components of building and running a software business, even as far as raising Venture Capital – and eventually selling (via an excellent Pecha Kucha presentation from [Alexis Ohanian](http://www.redditall.com/), founder of reddit.com)

Seriously, if you are at all involved in the software ***business*** then come next year (no dates or location yet), if for nothing else but the networking opportunities…

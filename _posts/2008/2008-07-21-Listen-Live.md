[![image](image_thumb.png)](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/ListenLive_E6C8/image_2.png)Too much effort reading my ramblings ? Want to listen instead ? Now you can !!

Courtesy of the excellent [odiogo](http://www.odiogo.com/), the excellent text to speech service. This is a free service that bloggers can use, it takes your RSS feed, splits it out to each separate post and then creates a MP3 for the post.

The text-to-speech quality is really good, only about 1 in 50 words is corrupt/unintelligible â€“ easily high enough quality to get a good rendition of the post. Obviously it depends on the content of the post, I have not yet listened to a post with lots of sample code or the like, but I expect it would be pretty hard going.

[Get the audio for this blog here](http://podcasts.odiogo.com/ken-hughes-/podcasts-html.php). You can even subscribe in iTunes. I will also update the site to include the links in the sidebar.

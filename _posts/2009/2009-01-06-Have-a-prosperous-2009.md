In an effort to get my blogging back on track, and show some activity on my website, this is a quick post to wish everyone a prosperous 2009 !!

I have a number of posts planned, including more details on the Outlook to Windows Mobile Gateway SMSing project, more details on my Homebrew Home Server (after a lot of traffic from [Alex Kuretz](http://www.mediasmartserver.net/author/yakuza/) over at [www.mediasmartserver.net](http://www.mediasmartserver.net)) and some bits on PowerShell, WCF and more…

Happy New Year…

[![twitter_logo](twitter_logo_thumb.png)](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/RemoteControlviaTwitter_12B83/twitter_logo_2.png) [Twitter](http://twitter.com) is one of those applications / services that I’ve had trouble getting to grips with. For me it seems it’s like shouting about what you are doing right now to a huge audience that is not listening. Who really cares that @[kjhughes](http://twitter.com/kjhughes) is heading to the shops to get some Mint sauce ?? Maybe I’m just not that kind of social animal, maybe I don’t have enough friends using it, maybe I should ‘but in’ to other peoples conversations more, maybe I’m just plain boring…

I do see a use for it though (for me). It’s a pretty neat way to do some remote control stuff – like set up a Media Center recording, reboot my PC, and also it’s a neat way of getting updates, like new blog comment received, TV recording completed and the like….

So, right now I need to get my Outlook addin project completed, but right afterwards I’m planning an app that interfaces to [twitter](http://twitter.com) and accepts direct tweets as remote control instructions, and also can update me on specific events. I am also thinking about adding [twitter](http://twitter.com) alerts to [dasBlog](http://www.dasblog.info) (on comments, posts, errors, daily reports etc)

I can see myself getting immersed in this [twitter](http://twitter.com) thing…

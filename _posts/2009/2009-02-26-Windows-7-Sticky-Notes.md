The only issue I have with it is the dreadful font it uses – well my issue is not the font, it is the fact that you cannot change it to something more ‘normal’.

I mean, I can easily change the font for Outlook Notes. I know, I know, you want it to look like handwritten notes that you would stick on your fridge at home, but hey – this isn’t my fridge at home, it’s my PC at work (and unfortunately there is no cold beer inside it !!).

[Eileen Brown](http://blogs.technet.com/eileen_brown/) confirmed for me that there is no way to change it right now (in the beta – build 7000), but there may be a [‘Non UI’ way of changing it](http://twitter.com/eileenb/status/1230829623) in the official release…

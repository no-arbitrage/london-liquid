[![handheldgps](handheldgps_thumb.jpg)](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/OnbecomingtheGeoGuy_130D0/handheldgps_2.jpg) Apparently I am rapidly becoming ‘Geo Guy’. I seem to be adding Geo / Gps support and plug-ins to everything I use…[![plugins](plugins_thumb.jpg)](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/OnbecomingtheGeoGuy_130D0/plugins_2.jpg)

I just finished adding [‘Insert GPS Link’](http://code.google.com/p/pocketwit/source/detail?r=1011) support to [PockeTwit](http://code.google.com/p/pocketwit/) (a great little Windows Mobile twitter client – really, go and get a copy now…)  
Previously I added [GeoRSS support to dasBlog](https://kapie.com/2007/09/08/GeoRssForDasBlog.aspx) for individual blog posts as well as the RSS feed, and I also added [geo microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/geo) support to Windows Live Writer with my [‘InsertGeoMicroformat’ plugin](https://kapie.com/2007/09/15/InsertGeoMicroformatPluginForWindowsLiveWriter.aspx).

So, what’s next – have you got an app that needs Geo / GPS support added ?

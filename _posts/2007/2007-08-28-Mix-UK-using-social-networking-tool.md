[![Mixuk](Mixuk_thumb.png)](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/MixUKusingsocialnetworkingtool_E869/Mixuk.png) I registered for [Mix:UK](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/mix07/) a few weeks ago and today got an email from the Mix team about a [social networking tool they are using to help people make the most of the conference](http://mix07.backnetwork.com/default.aspx).

[![backnetwork](backnetwork_thumb.png)](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/MixUKusingsocialnetworkingtool_E869/backnetwork.png)They are using [backnetwork](http://www.backnetwork.com/), which allows creation of profiles, blogging, photos, adding friends / colleagues etc (all the usual social networking stuff). It also allows you to add any colleagues / friends automagically from any previous backnetwork events you have been to.

 This is certainly a step in the right direction, but it’s missing an ‘auto-suggest relationship’ feature that could analyze your profile (or tags) and suggest other people who have similar interests.

So… [my profile is here](http://mix07.backnetwork.com/people/person.aspx?personid=80), anyone interested in any of my tags feel free to contact me and set up a meeting/chat/lunch/coffee/whatever…

This week (so far) has been good – in terms of completing things, productivity and new products.

First off, Microsoft finally released [PowerShell for Vista](http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2007/01/29/windows-powershell-1-0-for-windows-vista.aspx). No more having to ‘play’ on my old lab machine to get to grips with this stuff. There seem to be a number of people reporting failed installs(due to EFS encryption being disabled), just read the comments of the PowerShell blog announcement.

Next, we’re just coming to the final couple of days of a ‘Supporting Exchange 2007, Office 2007 and Vista SPRINT’ at [work](http://www.c2c.com/) (we use a form of SCRUM as our development process) – all is looking good and we have beta sites lined up.

Then, I noticed [Eileen’s](http://blogs.technet.com/eileen_brown/default.aspx) (**the** most communicative Microsoft employee on the planet) post about Office 2003 to Office 2007 command references. An interactive demo from Microsoft when you can click the toolbars and menus of an Office 2003 application and it tells you how to find the equivalent command/function in Office 2007. I spent some time finding the 10 or so commands I’d been having difficulty with and increased my productivity.  
Here’s her post : [http://blogs.technet.com/eileen\_brown/archive/2007/01/31/old-to-new-reference-guides.aspx](http://blogs.technet.com/eileen_brown/archive/2007/01/31/old-to-new-reference-guides.aspx "http://blogs.technet.com/eileen_brown/archive/2007/01/31/old-to-new-reference-guides.aspx")

Then late last night (again at [work](http://www.c2c.com/)) we just completed our internal testing before sending our Archive One product for Microsoft Platform testing. We are testing against 5 of the 6 platform tests (we don’t fit into the ‘Managed Code’ test category as we make extensive use of MAPI which basically requires C++ / Unmanaged code)

[![ruby_kaiserchiefs](ruby_kaiserchiefs_3.jpg)](http://www.kaiserchiefs.co.uk/index.php?id=298) Sarah wanted ‘Ruby Ruby Ruby’ by the [Kaiser Chiefs](http://www.kaiserchiefs.co.uk/) as her ringtone. Her mobile doesn’t have any easy way of connecting to a PC, so she joined one of the rip-off ‘Ringtones R Us’ services that force you into paying £4.50 / week for as many ringtone downloads as you want (***aside**: I must be getting old – why would anyone want to change their ringtone that often ??*).

Anyway, after downloading the mp3 she found it start relatively quietly and she was missing some calls. What she had actually wanted was the chorus….

So cue ***Kens Do It Yourself Ringtone Creater and Transferer***… [![image](image_thumb.png)](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Doityourselfringtones_CBB9/image_2.png)

Step by step instructions :-

2.  Download [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/).
3.  Cut the chorus out of the original track (loaded MP3 file)
4.  Create a new stereo track and paste the chorus into the new track.

6.  Play / listen to the new track, make sure you are happy with it.
7.  Download [lame\_enc.dll](http://lame.sourceforge.net/index.php) to allow [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) to export as MP3 ([see this Audacity FAQ](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/help/faq?s=install&item=lame-mp3))
8.  Export the new track from [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) as an MP3.

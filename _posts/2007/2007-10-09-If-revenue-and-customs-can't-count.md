Ok, so maybe this is a rant, and maybe it is due to the fact I forgot my annual Pay As You Earn (PAYE) employers return and was fined £400…

But seriously…

This is the government!  
This is the part of the government that calculates how much our taxes are!!  
This is *intelligent* automated software that they’ve had designed that ***should*** be 200% **idiot proof**.

I’ve had no employees for the past 12 months and I’m trying to submit (basically) an empty / null return.

Apparently I have employees on the list for whom I have not completed a P14 – note the list displays no employees, there’s another summary page later on that tells me I’m submitting for 0 employees, ***so they know !!!!***

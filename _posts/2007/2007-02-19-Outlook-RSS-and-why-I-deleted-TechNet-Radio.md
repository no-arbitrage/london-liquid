I have been using the new RSS feed feature in Outlook 2007 for some time now and absolutely love it – I’m in Outlook ALL day, it’s the centre of my communication universe and having it collate my RSS feeds just makes sense.

I’m a regular listener to a few podcasts :

-   [Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com)
-   [Dot Net Rocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/)
-   [The MicroISV Show](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/The_MicroISV_Show)

and until today [TechNet Radio](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/TechNet_Radio)…

I have Outlook set to download enclosures automatically (so for the podcast shows I get the MP3 directly into my mailbox. Whilst this bloats my mailbox (as you’ll see later) I work for an Email Archiving company (C2C) and my RSS feeds folder has an ***‘older than 21 days and is read’*** policy applied to it. We are also about to extend support for the RSS items making it even easier to identify them in a policy.

On looking at what I thought was new items in that feed I found that it was downloading all the feed items again (the same one’s I already have). My status bar tells me that it’s got 498MB to update  and it’s going to take 8 hours.

On looking further I find that I already have 4 copies of most of this stuff…

[![](TechnetRadioDeleted_thumb%5B2%5D.png)](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/OutlookRSSandwhyIdeletedTechnetRadio_13D77/TechnetRadioDeleted%5B4%5D.png)So I go ahead and delete all the duplicates then examine the size of my ‘Deleted Items’ folder.

Almost 1.5GB

Okay, had enough ditch it all and delete the feed.

I mean, come on guys, what is going on – no one else gives me this hassle, the Pwop Productions guys ([Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com) and [DotNetRocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/)) are fine, as is [The MicroISV Show](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/The_MicroISV_Show) – never any errors or duplicates – and there MP3 have intelligent tags, like the name of the show and/or guest names instead of something like :

*TechNet Radio – 21 December 2006*

and their’s is tagged with a Genre of Podcast not just left blank…

End of rant, end of my subscription to [TechNet Radio](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/TechNet_Radio).

[![DownloadDocument](DownloadDocument_thumb.png)](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Word2007OpeningPDFFiles_DF82/DownloadDocument.png) Today I was looking around for some MSCRM info. I came across a great document on the Microsoft Website, Using [Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0 Small Business Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/dynamics/crm/using/sbeguide.mspx). It is a PDF file but on their Website it has a little Word icon next to it and is described as a ‘Microsoft Word file’.

This got me wondering if they were now describing it as this because Word 2007 can work with PDF files ?

I have the PDF add-in for Office 2007 so I right clicked on the file (after downloading it to my desktop) and chose ‘Open With’  ..  ‘Microsoft Word 2007’.[![ConvertDocument](ConvertDocument_thumb.png)](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Word2007OpeningPDFFiles_DF82/ConvertDocument.png)

I was then presented with a ‘ File Conversion’ dialog. I left the settings as default and cracked on (clicked OK).

This opened Word and *munged* in a load of initial PDF data from the file.

About 8 minutes later after a ***lot*** of repagination. It tells me that I have exceeded the maximum number of pages supported by Word.

and from the Word status bar I can see the limit is 32,767  [![Pages](Pages_thumb.png)](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Word2007OpeningPDFFiles_DF82/Pages.png)

**Note to self**: *Read PDF’s in Foxit Reader, not Word*.

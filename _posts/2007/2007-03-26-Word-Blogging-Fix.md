On 13 December 2006 I wrote [this post demonstrating why Blogging from Word 2007 to Dasblog (and other blogs that correctly implemented newMediaObject)](https://kapie.com/2006/12/13/Why+Blogging+From+Word+2007+To+Dasblog+Does+Not+Work.aspx) was broken. Recently I noticed a number of my referrals come from [www.codesecurely.com](http://www.codesecurely.com) (by Rudolph Araujo).

Rudolph goes one step further than I did with the Word blogging problem and actually outlines a FiddlerScript that modifies the Xml section of the submitted post to fix the integer/string mismatch. [His article is here.](http://www.codesecurely.org/archive/2007/02/25/blogging-from-microsoft-word.aspx)

Well done Rudolph, thanks for the tip, I look forward to posting from Word now…

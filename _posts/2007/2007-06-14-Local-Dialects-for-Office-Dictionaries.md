[This is pretty cool](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/dialect/default.mspx). Microsoft (in the UK) are creating downloadable dictionaries for Office that contain words from local dialects.  
It is only a matter of time before I can type:

***It wisnae me that smashed the windae wi the fitba!     (TRANS: it was not I that smashed the window with the soccer ball)***

Without the little red squiggles underneath.

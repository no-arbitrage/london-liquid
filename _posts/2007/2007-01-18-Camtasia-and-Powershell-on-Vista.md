I’ve been on Vista (on my work laptop) for a couple of months now and finding it really difficult to get some stuff done.

I’m (directly) working on some training modules for our [Archive One](http://www.c2c.com/) products and managing / assisting a couple of people who are working on Sales Video Demos of these products.

The Sales Video Demo are making extensive use of [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp) and my training modules are making some use of it. Their version 4.0.0 of [Camtasia Studio](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp) is [not supported on Vista](http://techsmith.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/techsmith.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=725&p_created=1157555823&p_sid=Cc32--ri&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MiZwX3Byb2RzPTYmcF9jYXRzPSZwX3B2PTEuNiZwX2N2PSZwX3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPWFuc3dlcnMuc2VhcmNoX25sJnBfcGFnZT0xJnBfc2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9dmlzdGE*&p_li=&p_topview=1) and I can verify that it DOES NOT work on it (although you CAN install it, expect to get lots of application errors / crashes).  
[TechSmith](http://www.techsmith.com/) (the makers [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp)) say that there is [limited functionality available under Vista](http://techsmith.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/techsmith.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=800&p_created=1161186317&p_sid=Cc32--ri&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MiZwX3Byb2RzPTYmcF9jYXRzPSZwX3B2PTEuNiZwX2N2PSZwX3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPWFuc3dlcnMuc2VhcmNoX25sJnBfcGFnZT0xJnBfc2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9dmlzdGE*&p_li=&p_topview=1) (you can record your screen to AVI format, but that’s it).

There is a beta version of [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp) available [from here](http://groups.msn.com/camtasia-vista) that works with Vista (pretty well actually) and the [TechSmith](http://www.techsmith.com/) guys plan to release full support for Vista by the end of this month.

As we’re heavily into [Exchange Server](http://www.microsoft.com/exchange) and the 2007 version is now released (and makes extensive use of [Powershell](http://www.microsoft.com/powershell) of management), I’ve been meaning to get to grips with [Powershell](http://www.microsoft.com/powershell).

[Powershell](http://www.microsoft.com/powershell) is NOT supported under Vista yet either. They do have a Powershell RC2 available that works under Vista RC1 (build 5600). The details are available from their [download page](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/download.mspx). Vista support is also planned for the end of this month.

I guess I should have probably waited a bit longer before migrating to Vista. Anyway in the meantime I have a test Win2003 Server set up that I’m using for [Powershell](http://www.microsoft.com/powershell).

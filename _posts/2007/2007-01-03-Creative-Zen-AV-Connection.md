A definition of the AV pinouts for various media equipment and particularly the Creative ZEN.

I already have a Camcorder Cable, so one of the tricks I found in some AV forums is to fully insert the 3.5mm connector and then **pull it out by one click.** If you do the maths it means you get Video, Ground and Right Channel Audio.

Trying this on my unit (with my Camcorder Cable) it works pretty well.[](https://kapie.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CreativeZenAVConnection_13440/av-pinouts%5B4%5D.jpg)

The excellent [RSSPopper](http://rsspopper.blogspot.com/2004/10/home.html) (version 0.31) expired on me this morning. After visiting their website I found stable version 0.32 which is valid until 1 Dec 2006.

Downloaded it, installed (over the top of the 0.31 expired version) â€“ it just worked, all my feeds intact etc.

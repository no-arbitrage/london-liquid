I just spent a few hours setting up [nGallery](http://www.ngallery.org) on my site. It was real easy, very simple install, *just worked !!* **AND IT’s FREE !!**

I then hacked around with a template for a bit and got it looking the same as the rest of my website (which uses the [Dasblog](http://www.dasblog.net) Portal – Compass theme)

Basically I have a welcome screen which is a hacked version of a single blog entry, that is static and then ‘under’ that I now have my weblog ([Dasblog](http://www.dasblog.net)) and my photos ([nGallery](http://www.ngallery.org)). Everything has the same theme and it all looks pretty good (even if I do say so myself).

If you’d like details of my hacks or a copy of the [nGallery](http://www.ngallery.org) theme then let me know, I do plan to make it publically available (on the [nGallery](http://www.ngallery.org) site) but it’s not quite at that stage yet – stay tuned…

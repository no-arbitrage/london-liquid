I popped out at lunchtime to by my brother’s Christmas present. I went to [Cotswold Camping](http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com), I’ve always been a great fan of them (and [Field and Trek](http://www.fieldandtrek.co.uk)), ever since my Army days getting me a 10% discount.

I had noticed from their website that they are selling the [Berghaus Sullivan III jacket at the discounted price of £120 (normally £200)](http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/Cat/118939?Ref=). Having looked at the Sullivan previously as a good outer shell in 3 layer Goretex (not many using 3 layer now), I just could not resist buying it there and then.

It’s a fairly basic 3 layer outer shell garment, no frills, 2 mid pockets (allowing access even with a rucksack waist belt done up) and a wired hood that can be secured down with poppers. None of your ‘underarm ventilation zips’, ’56 different pockets including one for your mobile phone and one for your smoking pipe’ etc. – It’s just the kind of thing you cry out for on the hill when the rain is horizontal looks like it’s settled in for the whole week (instead of the ‘trendy’ paper-thin Paclite you decided to wear and have found that your freezing and soaked, but you did save 170 grams…)

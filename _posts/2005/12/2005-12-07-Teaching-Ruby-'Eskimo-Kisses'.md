This morning, as usual I got up with Ruby at around 7am, took her downstairs whilst I made some tea and had a bit of breakfast.

I then spent 5 minutes teaching her how to do ‘Eskimo Kisses’ (rubbing noses together). She thought this was hilarious (she *is* only 16 months old currently) and remembered the word ‘Eskimo’. Now every time I say it she rubs her nose against yours and laughs.

This may not seem a big deal, but what a great start to my day – I know it’s going to be good and I hadn’t even left for work at that stage…

I have just changed my mobile phone to the new [Samsung D600](http://www.samsung.com/uk/products/mobilephones/mobilephones/sgh_d600haatmu.asp) (perviously I had always used Nokia models). The Samsung phone is pretty good, it provides me with a 2 mega pixel camera, micro SD slot (which I filled with a 512MB card, so now my phone are over 600MB of storage available), MPEG4 capability, 240 by 320 262K colour screen and Picsel Viewer software (read Word, Excel, PDF and html docs).

I like the phone, but the software is a bit clunky, sending an SMS to someone in the phonebook is a lot of steps – after composing the message I have to hit :-

-   Options
-   Send Only
-   Options
-   Phonebook
-   Then ‘browse’ to the contact
-   OK (to check the checkbox for the contact)
-   Select
-   Options
-   Send

This is just to long. I use txt message to send very short snippets when I don’t want to disturb the receipent, having to go through this rigmarole is going to stop me using txt messaging.

Another feature I like is being able to configure the USB connection as ‘Mass Storage’ making the phone look like a removeable drive to my PC. However there seems to be a issue with this option in that it always reverts back to ‘Modem’ when I switch the phone off.

Final dissapointment is the lack of open standards / information about the thing. On the display settings I can choose what theme to apply – there is a choice of 2, imaginatively named Pattern 1 and Pattern 2 and the other setting is where I want to display the operator logo (top, bottom or off). I have to ask, ‘Why is there no option to modify these or to add your own themes ?’ – a little bit of thought on this side would have bumped the phone up from ‘good’ to ‘killer’ – I already have a USB connection, just publish the format / schema or whatever and let me get creative…

I’m a great fan of the excelllent and free [RSS Poppper](http://www.rsspopper.com) which aggregates all my chosen feeds into a mailbox folder in Outlook (Outlook is my main daily workspace, I do everything from there).

Yesterday, I found myself considering using Glen Scales’ [Public folder RSS Feed Event sink v2](http://gsexdev.blogspot.com/2004/09/public-folder-rss-feed-event-sink-v2.html) to create an RSS feed from one of our company’s shared Public Folders (PF) so that I could pull it directly into my mailbox via [RSS Popper](http://www.rsspopper.com).

This kinda sounds a bit stupid but it gives me direct access (in a standard place) to all my chosen information – I can read the PF posts along side my other feeds.

The other option is to set my email in the Public Folder properties as a ‘forward all to’ in addition to having the posts delivered to the PF – either way I’m duplicating data and increasing the size of the exchange store….

Luckily I work for an email archiving company and we use our products inhouse, so I don’t have to worry about exchange store size, we’re also just about to release SIS (Single Instance Storage) so data will not duplicated either…

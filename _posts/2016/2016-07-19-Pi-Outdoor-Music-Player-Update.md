Finally completed the V1 Pi Outdoor Music Player. This is an old power tool case modified to mount/contain:

-   Speakers mounted on the top/face.
-   A 3Watt 5Volt stereo audio amp.
-   A 20,000mAh portable battery pack.
-   A Raspberry Pi B+ with a Wifi dongle, running [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org/) and [ympd](https://www.ympd.org/).

Sound is loud enough for a family BBQ and decent quality. The stereo amp has a volume control to allow adjustment. The wifi dongle (and ympd) allow the music and playlists to be controlled via a phone or tablet.

A full write up on the project will be coming shortly…
